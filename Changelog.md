## v11.315.304.7
Closes [63](https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/63) with a new setting for `AC5e targeting options`. <br><br>
When 0 or more than 1 targets are selected, AC5e will not be able by default to calculate correctly advantageMode/damageMode as this is done based on the first of the `game.user.targets` only. There is now a setting for the GM to decide how AC5e will deal with targeting and rolling an Attack or Damage, or try to Use an Item that has an attack and Target any of the Individual target options in its details tab. The options are as follows:
   * `From Source Only`: The advantageMode/damageMode will be calculated based on effects/conditions etc on the Source actor only (___default option___),
   * `Do nothing`: No calculations whatsoever will take place,
   * `Enforce targeting`: Will cancel the incoming Roll or Item use, and display a warning for the user to target `1 Target` (___Use with caution___).


## v11.315.304.6.8
* Fix bug when rolling an attack and automated encumbrance is true.

## v11.315.304.6.7
* Default settings fix.
  * Tooltips on
